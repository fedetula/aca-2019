For 2020:
    - add timing analysis (explore timing failure on implementation)
    - decode signals in waveform
    - create docker to re-use project.tcl with students
    - add reporting scripts (area, timing, error checking)
    - provide restricted riscv assembler for used instructions only
    - provide assembler simulator to test their own fibonacci code
